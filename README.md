This code consists of several notebooks for Chapter 4 of my dissertation. It is by no means the most efficient code, but it gets the job done. Most of these notebooks will serve as figure plotting references.

Notebooks included:
1. Pre-processing sea level pressure data - EC-Earth3
2. Pre-processing sea surface height data - EC-Earth3
